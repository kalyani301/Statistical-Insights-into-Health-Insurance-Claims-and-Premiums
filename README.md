# Statistical-Insights-into-Health-Insurance-Claims-and-Premiums
# introduction

This project analyzes health insurance claim data using Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) and Multiple Logistic Regression to support insurers in risk management and pricing decisions. The main objectives are:

Risk Prediction: Identify factors affecting claim frequency and amount.

Premium Calculation: Develop fair pricing based on risk profiles.

Health Risk Profiling: Analyze policyholder health and its impact on claims.

Fraud Detection: Detect patterns indicating fraudulent claims.

Cost Forecasting: Predict future claim costs using demographics and health data.

The study aims to support data-driven decisions, optimize resources, and reduce financial risk for insurance companies.

# objective

Identify Key Risk Factors: Determine the most influential variables predicting the likelihood of a claim to assist actuaries.

Premium Adjustment: Set a base premium and modify it based on individual risk categories (Low, Medium, High).

Variable Association: Use Welch’s two-sample t-test to assess relationships between key variables.

Underdispersion Handling: Apply a quasi-likelihood approach for skewed response data with constant coefficient of variation.

Fraud Detection: Detect suspicious claim patterns to identify potential fraud.
